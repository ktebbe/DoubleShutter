## Rules of the Game

Double Shutter is one of those games that has a simple mechanism and complicated strategy. There are two rows of tiles, 1-9, and two six-sided die. The rules are simple: roll the dice, knock down tiles that add up to the dice total, and repeat until you get a dice roll you can't match with tiles (You Lose) or you knock down all of the tiles (You Win!). 

Your score is the sum of all remaining tiles, with any remaining front row tiles being doubled. 

## The Simulation
This seemed like the perfect game to simulate - it's self-contained enough to replicate with code, yet it's tough to determine the best strategy without many, many rounds. So that's what I did!
